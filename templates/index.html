      <p>
        Pioneers in Engineering is a non-profit organization that provides a quality STEM learning experience for students in underserved Bay Area high schools. Our primary services are a year-long mentorship program called Prep and an annual 8-week robotics competition. For just $100 per team, we provide a robotics kit that's fully designed and developed in-house, as well as trained college student mentors for each team.
